<h1> Lesson One: The Basics Of The Web And HTML <p> Key Themes</h1>
<b>The Web Explained</b>
<p> The web is, in essence, computers communicating with each other using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to manage the relevant commands. From a users point of view, going to a web site involves their computer sending an HTTP request to a server. The server then finds the document (the web is really a collection of these HTML documents) and sends it back to the users computer where their web browser displays it on the screen. HTML is always there in the background working away but most of the time the user can't see it. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a>
  does a good job of explaining.</p>
<b> More on HTML</b>
<p>HTML documents form the majority of content on the web. The documents contain both the text and the HTML code which dictates how the text appears in the browser. This is the "mark up" function of HTML - marking up the text using code so that it appears in a specific way. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This
  video</a> gives a good overview.</p>
<b>What's Inside an HTML Document?</b>
<p> HTML documents are made up of <em>Elements</em> and <em>Tags</em>. Elements are the bits that make up web pages and tags surround them, giving them meaning. Tags can have a defined beginning and end but this is not always the case. One good example of this is the line break tag where there is no defined end point. Tags help browsers understand the type of content that they are dealing with. Elements can be either in line or block. Block elemts draw an invisible box around the content. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  gives a bit more detail.</p>
<b>Computers Follow Your Instructions Literally</b>
<p> Computers can acheive impressive things but they depend on the quality of their instructions. Their completely <b>literal</b> interpretation of their instructions can lead to frustrations as a small error by a programmer can have a big impact and require much troubleshooting.</p>
